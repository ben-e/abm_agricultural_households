# Agent Based Agricultural Household Modeling

This is an attempt at applying agent based modeling (ABM) to microeconomic agricultural household models. Ideally, ABM will allow for more heterogenous agents (e.g. good farmers and bad farmers) and conditions (e.g. good land and bad land) than are analytically feasible.
