# Agent Based Agricultural Household Modeling

This is an attempt at applying agent based modeling (ABM) to microeconomic agricultural household models. Ideally, ABM will allow for more heterogenous agents (e.g. good farmers and bad farmers) and conditions (e.g. good land and bad land) than are analytically feasible.

## Layout

This project is organized as follows:

* data: Datasets.
* figures: Figures.
* notebooks: I use notebooks to explore new ideas informally. These are not necessarily Jupyter or Rmd notebooks.
* r: R scripts that do things more defined than notebooks.
