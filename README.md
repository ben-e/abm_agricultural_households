# Agent Based Agricultural Household Modeling

This is an attempt at applying agent based modeling (ABM) to microeconomic agricultural household models. Ideally, ABM will allow for more heterogenous agents (e.g. good farmers and bad farmers) and conditions (e.g. good land and bad land) than are analytically feasible.

## Layout

This project is organized as follows:

* data
    * raw: Raw data that has not been altered.
    * processed: Data that has been transformed, combined, etc. in some way.
* figures: Plots and figures.
* notebooks: I use notebooks (in the spirit of Jupyter notebooks) to explore new ideas informally.
* r: R scripts that do things.
